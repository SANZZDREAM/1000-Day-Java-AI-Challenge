🔍 About Me
I'm Sanjay, a tech-obsessed creator from Tamil Nadu, India, currently pursuing my journey toward becoming an AI Engineer and future robotics software developer. With a passion rooted deeply in machine learning, creative technology, and automation, I’m building myself from the ground up—one project, one line of code at a time.

🚀 My Dream: In 10 years, I plan to launch an AI-powered robotics software ecosystem called Sanzz Dream, blending intelligence, automation, and creativity.

📚 Educational Background
🏫 Currently pursuing B.Tech with a specialization in AI, Data Science & Software Systems

📖 Focus Areas:

Machine Learning & Deep Learning

Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
